# CodeAlpha_Stock
This project is a **Stock Portfolio Management System** built using **Flask** and the **Alpha Vantage API**. It allows users to manage their stock portfolios by adding, removing, and viewing stocks. The application retrieves real-time stock data from the Alpha Vantage API, updating the portfolio with the latest market prices every time a user checks their holdings. The project is designed as a simple RESTful API where users can add stocks to their portfolio by specifying the stock symbol, quantity, and purchase price. They can also remove stocks from their portfolio. The `/portfolio` endpoint provides a summary of the current portfolio, showing the latest stock prices, the total value of the portfolio, and the profit or loss compared to the initial purchase price.

The app makes use of the **requests** library to communicate with the Alpha Vantage API and **dotenv** to securely manage API keys through environment variables. To set up the project, users need to clone the repository, create a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and provide their own Alpha Vantage API key in a `.env` file. Once set up, the app can be run locally, and users can interact with it via HTTP requests to manage their stock portfolios. This project provides a foundational system for managing stock investments and can be expanded with additional features like user authentication, historical data, or portfolio analytics.
